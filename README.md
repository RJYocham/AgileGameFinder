# Agile Exercise - Game Finder

## About
Our goal was to use agile to plan out an app that can pull a list of games by gaming system or genre. 
Eventually we would have liked to add the ability to organize games by number of players or MSRB Rating.

## Trello
We used Trello to make our user stories, create and assign tasks, as well as track progress. 
We used color coding to assign a task to a team member, as well as to assign a Fibanacci Rule point value to each task.
